            Medical Ultrasound ({US}) imaging has seen increasing demands over the past years, becoming one of the most preferred imaging modalities in clinical practice due to its affordability, portability, and real-time capabilities. However, it faces several challenges that limit its applicability, such as operator dependency, variability in interpretation, and limited resolution, which are amplified by the low availability of trained experts. This calls for the need of autonomous systems that are capable of reducing the dependency on humans for increased efficiency and throughput. Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) comes as a rapidly advancing field under Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) that allows the development of autonomous and intelligent agents through rewarded interactions with their environments. Several existing surveys on advancements in {US} imaging predominantly focus on partially autonomous {AI} solutions. However, none of these surveys explore the intersection between the stages of the {US} process and the recent advancements in {RL} solutions. To bridge this gap, this survey proposes a comprehensive taxonomy that integrates the stages of the {US} process with the {RL} development pipeline -including data preparation, problem formulation, simulation environment, {RL} training, validation and finetuning- and reviews current research efforts under this taxonomy. This work aims to highlight the potential of {RL} in building autonomous {US} solutions while identifying limitations and opportunities for further advancements in this field.},

            This survey paper explores the transformative role of Machine Learning ({ML}) and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ({CPR}), marking a paradigm shift from conventional, manually driven resuscitation practices to intelligent, data-driven interventions. It examines the evolution of {CPR} through the lens of predictive modeling, {AI}-enhanced devices, and real-time decision-making tools that collectively aim to improve resuscitation outcomes and survival rates. Unlike prior surveys that either focus solely on traditional {CPR} methods or offer general insights into {ML} applications in healthcare, this work provides a novel interdisciplinary synthesis tailored specifically to the domain of {CPR}. It presents a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies {ML} techniques into four key {CPR}-related tasks: rhythm analysis, outcome prediction, non-invasive blood pressure and chest compression modeling, and real-time detection of pulse and Return of Spontaneous Circulation ({ROSC}). The paper critically evaluates emerging {ML} approaches-including Reinforcement Learning ({RL}) and transformer-based models-while also addressing real-world implementation barriers such as model interpretability, data limitations, and deployment in high-stakes clinical settings. Furthermore, it highlights the role of {eXplainable} {AI} ({XAI}) in fostering clinical trust and adoption. By bridging the gap between resuscitation science and advanced {ML} techniques, this survey establishes a structured foundation for future research and practical innovation in {ML}-enhanced {CPR}. It offers clear insights, identifies unexplored opportunities, and sets a forward-looking research agenda identifying emerging trends and practical implementation challenges aiming to improve both the reliability and effectiveness of {CPR} in real-world emergencies.},
