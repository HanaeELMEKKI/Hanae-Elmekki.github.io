abstract: |
  This paper presents **CACTUS** (Cardiac Assessment and Classification of Ultrasound), a publicly available dataset and deep learning framework designed to support automated cardiac ultrasound image analysis. The dataset integrates a diverse collection of echocardiographic views and patient conditions, enabling reproducible benchmarking for cardiac image classification tasks. The accompanying framework leverages **deep transfer learning** to enhance diagnostic accuracy and generalization across imaging settings. CACTUS represents a key step toward open, data-driven research in medical ultrasound automation and cardiovascular health assessment.

summary: An open dataset and deep learning framework for automated cardiac ultrasound image analysis.
