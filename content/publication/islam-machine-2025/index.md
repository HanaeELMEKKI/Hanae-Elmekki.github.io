abstract: 'Abstract This survey paper explores the transformative role of Machine
  Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
  (CPR), marking a paradigm shift from conventional, manually driven resuscitation
  practices to intelligent, data-driven interventions. It examines the evolution of
  CPR through the lens of predictive modeling, AI-enhanced devices, and real-time
  decision-making tools that collectively aim to improve resuscitation outcomes and
  survival rates. Unlike prior surveys that either focus solely on traditional CPR
  methods or offer general insights into ML applications in healthcare, this work
  provides a novel interdisciplinary synthesis tailored specifically to the domain
  of CPR. It presents a comprehensive taxonomy that classifies ML techniques into
  four key CPR-related tasks: rhythm analysis, outcome prediction, non-invasive blood
  pressure and chest compression modeling, and real-time detection of pulse and Return
  of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC). The paper critically evaluates emerging ML approaches-including
  Reinforcement Learning (RL) and transformer-based models-while also addressing real-world
  implementation barriers such as model interpretability, data limitations, and deployment
  in high-stakes clinical settings. Furthermore, it highlights the role of eXplainable
  AI (XAI) in fostering clinical trust and adoption. By bridging the gap between resuscitation
  science and advanced ML techniques, this survey establishes a structured foundation
  for future research and practical innovation in ML-enhanced CPR. It offers clear
  insights, identifies unexplored opportunities, and sets a forward-looking research
  agenda identifying emerging trends and practical implementation challenges aiming
  to improve both the reliability and effectiveness of CPR in real-world emergencies.'
